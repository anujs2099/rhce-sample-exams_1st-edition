# Understanding Modules to Check
- uri
- script
- stat --> checks on file or directory status and gets information about it
- assert --> if something is true, print a message. If it is not true, print a different message. Like fail module. Used with 'that' argument. Not with 'when' statement.
- fail --> if something is true, fail the whole task. Used with when statement.
